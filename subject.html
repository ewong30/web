	<h2> History and Development of the SDGs </h2>
	<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are the fundamental blueprints constructed by many world leaders to achieve a more sustainable future for the world's governments, its people, and its commerce. Each of the sustainable development goals address a global challenge that the international community faces, from poverty to inequality, from climate change and environmental degradation to peace and justice. The non-profit project was established in 2015 under the United Nations General Assembly, and it has the ultimate end goal of Agenda 2030. This created the drafting of the 17 SDGs, involving: <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1">No Poverty</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">Zero Hunger</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">Good Health and Well Being</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4">Quality Education</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5">Gender Equality</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">Clean Water and Sanitation</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7">Affordable and Clean Energy</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">Decent Work and Economic Growth</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9">Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10">Reduced Inequalities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11">Sustainable Cities and Communities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">Responsible Consumption and Production</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">Climate Action</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">Life Below Water</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">Life on Land</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</a>, and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17">Partnerships for the Goals</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Where we see the Project Leading </h2>
	<p> Upon the creation of these goals, the United Nations General Assembly uses these SDGs as a means to push for resolutions in the UN that aim to tackle the need to decrease poverty margins, hunger crises, education, and more. These advances are all made in completing the project <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030</a>, which aims to strengthen universal peace, eradicate poverty, and help the people and planet prosper. In doing so, each nation will follow the 17 aformentioned Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets and complete each of them, one by one.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Current Progress </h2>
	<p> It's been five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the International Community— <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/">2020 Reports</a> note that progress has been made in some of the areas involving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity, and increasing women's representation in government. However, many advancements were halted by the encroaching food insecurity, deterioration of our environment, and persistant and deep-rooted inequalities.
		
		Not only that, but with the unleashing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world, further disruption on the SDG progress has been made— with the poorest and most vulnerable absolutely crippled. </p>

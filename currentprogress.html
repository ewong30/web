	<p class="pstyle"> It's been five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the International Community— <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/">2020 Reports</a> note that progress has been made in some of the areas involving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity, and increasing women's representation in government. However, many advancements were halted by the encroaching food insecurity, deterioration of our environment, and persistant and deep-rooted inequalities. <br>
		<br>
		Not only that, but with the unleashing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world, further disruption on the SDG progress has been made— with the poorest and most vulnerable absolutely crippled.</p>

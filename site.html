  <h2 class="headstyle">The SDGs</h2>
  <p class="pstyle">Established in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development goals, also known as the Global Goals, are a collection of 17 global goals to be a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for all. These blueprints, adopted by all members of the United Nations, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet into and for the future of the world. At its base, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are a call for action by all countries, finally recognizing the need to end poverty and other deprivations, which go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth. <br>  
	   <br> 
	   Aimed to be achieved by 2030, these goals aim to help to develop the world and serve as the main drivers to further our advancements in green technology and equality for all by 2030. The SDGs are each integrated, which means that they recognize that an action in one area will change other regions, and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The SDGs are designed to bring the world to several life-changing 'zeros', including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS, and discrimination against women and girls. Though ambitious, the creativity, technology, and financial resources are all accessible to achieve the SDGs in every context.</p>

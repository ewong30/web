	<p class="pstyle"> It's been five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the International Community— <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/">2020 Reports</a> note that progress has been made in some of the areas involving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity, and increasing women's representation in government. However, many advancements were halted by the encroaching food insecurity, deterioration of our environment, and persistant and deep-rooted inequalities. <br>
		<br>
		Not only that, but with the unleashing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world, further disruption on the SDG progress has been made— with the poorest and most vulnerable absolutely crippled. However, through the progress made through many pledges, such as the pledge to Leave No One Behind, many countries have become committed to prioritize a fast-track progress for those furthest behind. <br>
		<br>
		With over 169 targets, 2999 hosted events, 1248 publications, and over 5358 actions, the SDGs are proving to be an amazing blueprint that has begun to tackle the various issues across the globe. Between the 'zeros' goals and the no poverty goals, huge advancements are being made which continue to drive many non profit organizations, private state actors, good samaritans, and countries to rise up and grow.</p>

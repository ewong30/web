	<h2> History and Development of the SDGs </h2>
	<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are the fundamental blueprints constructed by many world leaders to achieve a more sustainable future for the world's governments, its people, and its commerce. Each of the sustainable development goals address a global challenge that the international community faces, from poverty to inequality, from climate change and environmental degradation to peace and justice. The non-profit project was established in 2015 under the United Nations General Assembly, and it has the ultimate end goal of Agenda 2030. This created the drafting of the 17 SDGs, involving: <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1">No Poverty</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">Zero Hunger</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">Good Health and Well Being</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4">Quality Education</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5">Gender Equality</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">Clean Water and Sanitation</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7">Affordable and Clean Energy</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">Decent Work and Economic Growth</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9">Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10">Reduced Inequalities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11">Sustainable Cities and Communities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">Responsible Consumption and Production</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">Climate Action</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">Life Below Water</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">Life on Land</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</a>, and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17">Partnerships for the Goals</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2> Where we see the Project Leading </h2>
	<p> Upon the creation of these goals, the United Nations General Assembly uses these SDGs as a means to push for resolutions in the UN that aim to tackle the need to decrease poverty margins, hunger crises, education, and more. These advances are all made in completing the project <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030</a>, which aims to strengthen universal peace, eradicate poverty, and help the people and planet prosper. In doing so, each nation will follow the 17 aformentioned Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets and complete each of them, one by one. </p>
	<p>The SDGs are comprehensive and integrated, yet relatable and built upon over decades of trying to build a different view on how we approach sustainability and development issues in our world. They aim to assist all countries— developed and undeveloped— shifting the development agenda to focus on social issues that include social, economic, and environmental elements, and encourage more domestic and private sector investment. The impacts and progress of these SDGs continue to help the international community improve by measuring more modern means. </p>
	<p>Within these goals, the world is avidly working to address situations such as food security, gender equality, poverty levels, and more— topics that were previously glossed over until now. With the establishment of these SDGs and the economic support they have garnered from the World Bank and other NGOs, the world is looking upwards in terms of improvements to society. </p>
	
	
	<h2> Current Progress </h2>
	<p> It's been five years since the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by the International Community— <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/">2020 Reports</a> note that progress has been made in some of the areas involving maternal and child health, expanding access to electricity, and increasing women's representation in government. However, many advancements were halted by the encroaching food insecurity, deterioration of our environment, and persistant and deep-rooted inequalities. </p>
		
	<p>Not only that, but with the unleashing of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world, further disruption on the SDG progress has been made— with the poorest and most vulnerable absolutely crippled.</p>

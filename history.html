	<h2 class="heading" id="history"> History and Development of the SDGs </h2>
	<p> The Sustainable Development Goals are the fundamental blueprints constructed by many world leaders to achieve a more sustainable future for the world's governments, its people, and its commerce. Each of the sustainable development goals address a global challenge that the international community faces, from poverty to inequality, from climate change and environmental degradation to peace and justice. The non-profit project was established in 2015 under the United Nations General Assembly, and it has the ultimate end goal of Agenda 2030. This created the drafting of the 17 SDGs, involving: <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1">No Poverty</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2">Zero Hunger</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3">Good Health and Well Being</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4">Quality Education</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5">Gender Equality</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6">Clean Water and Sanitation</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal7">Affordable and Clean Energy</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8">Decent Work and Economic Growth</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9">Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10">Reduced Inequalities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11">Sustainable Cities and Communities</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12">Responsible Consumption and Production</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13">Climate Action</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14">Life Below Water</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15">Life on Land</a>, <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16">Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions</a>, and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17">Partnerships for the Goals</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Though the goals are broad, the UN congregated two years later on July 6th, 2017 to adopt more "actionable" resolutions by the General Assembly. In doing this, the resolution drafted identifies specific targets for each goal with criteria to indicate progress towards each target goal. Each target varies in length from 2020 to 2030, but some targets have no end date in mind. In order to facilitate the achievement of these goals, a variety of tools to track and visualize the global progress towards these goals, providing more available and easily understood data. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.</li>
<li>Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015.</li>

<li>At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document "The Future We Want" in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.</li>
<li>In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member Open Working Group to develop a proposal on the SDGs.</li>

	<p> Upon the creation of these goals, the United Nations General Assembly uses these SDGs as a means to push for resolutions in the UN that aim to tackle the need to decrease poverty margins, hunger crises, education, and more. These advances are all made in completing the project <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">Agenda 2030</a>, which aims to strengthen universal peace, eradicate poverty, and help the people and planet prosper. In doing so, each nation will follow the 17 aformentioned Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets and complete each of them, one by one. </p>
	<p>The SDGs are comprehensive and integrated, yet relatable and built upon over decades of trying to build a different view on how we approach sustainability and development issues in our world. They aim to assist all countries— developed and undeveloped— shifting the development agenda to focus on social issues that include social, economic, and environmental elements, and encourage more domestic and private sector investment. The impacts and progress of these SDGs continue to help the international community improve by measuring more modern means. </p>
	<p>Within these goals, the world is avidly working to address situations such as food security, gender equality, poverty levels, and more— topics that were previously glossed over until now. With the establishment of these SDGs and the economic support they have garnered from the World Bank and other NGOs, the world is looking upwards in terms of improvements to society. </p>
